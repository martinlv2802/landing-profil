			<h2> Skills </h2>
			<p>
				I am passionate about many things in life because I take things to heart quickly. However, I have a particular attraction for the forest and its inhabitants that I love to observe🐗.

			<h2>Cursus 📚</h2>
			<p>
				First of all I did a baccalaureate ES in Tours, I obtained it with the mention good + European English.
                Then I took the competitive exams for business school.

                I chose to go to Lille, because it was my first choice since the IESEG is the first of the post baccalaureate schools 🇫🇷. 

                I am currently in my 2nd year, I still have 3 years left in this school before entering the working world 👷.  However, during these next 3 years, I will go to Casablanca 🇲🇦 for 6 months and to Bangkok 🇹🇭 for 6 months because I have to do part of my studies abroad.
